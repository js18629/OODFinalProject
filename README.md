Notepad --

Project Objective
We are creating a better version of notepad ++

Pattern Descriptions
Command: This behavioral design pattern which is useful to abstract business logic into discrete actions which we normally call commands. This command object helps in loose coupling between two classes where one class (invoker) calls a method on another class (receiver) to perform an operation.

Facade: The ConnectionManager facade handles socket connection initialization and object stream configuration subsystems with simplified instruction sets.

Factory: With the Factory Pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created objects using a common interface.

Observer?

Adaptor: The adapter pattern converts the user interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.


The Process

Starting Point:
  Our initial program will be a text editor
  Gather up our ideas

Involution:
  Description of our patterns and analysis
  Test Cases

Set Up:
  Development and Implementation
  Integrate all of our patterns
  Editing / Revision

Final Adjustment:
  Testing
  Have all the documentation
