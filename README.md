Project Objective
We are creating a better version of notepad ++

Pattern Descriptions
Command: This behavioral design pattern which is useful to abstract business logic into discrete actions which we normally call commands. This command object helps in loose coupling between two classes where one class (invoker) calls a method on another class (receiver) to perform an operation.

Observer: Where an object maintains a list of its dependants, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes.

Visitor: Used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.

Composite: The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. 

Strategy: With this pattern we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.


The Process

Starting Point:
  Our initial program will be a text editor
  Gather up our ideas

Involution:
  Description of our patterns and analysis
  Test Cases

Set Up:
  Development and Implementation
  Integrate all of our patterns
  Editing / Revision

Final Adjustment:
  Testing
  Have all the documentation
